# Contributing to Keyboard Warrior

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Keyboard Warrior!

## Current Status

Keyboard Warrior is a personal project in active development. While I welcome feedback and suggestions, please understand that contributions may not always be accepted if they don't align with the project's direction.

## Ways to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Check existing issues before opening a new one
- Include steps to reproduce bugs
- Describe expected vs actual behavior
- Include terminal/OS information if relevant

### Suggesting Features

- Open an issue with the `enhancement` label
- Describe the feature and its use case
- Explain how it fits with existing gameplay

### Code Contributions

1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the change
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
4. Make focused, incremental changes
5. Ensure `cargo check` passes with no warnings
6. Submit a pull request with a clear description

## Code Style

- Follow standard Rust conventions (`cargo fmt`)
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Use meaningful variable names

## What I'm Not Looking For

- Large refactors without prior discussion
- Changes to core game design without consultation
- Dependencies that significantly increase binary size
- Features that don't fit the terminal typing game genre

## Questions?

Open an issue with the `question` label.
